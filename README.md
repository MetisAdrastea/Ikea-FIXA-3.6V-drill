# Ikea-FIXA-3.6V-drill
Reverse engineering of the 8.90 EUR (-ish) Ikea FIXA 3.6V electric screwdriver

This schematic (draft) is obtained by reverse-engineering the PCB.

It was intended for using the motor/battery/charging circuit in random projects.

Make sure this is the correct schematic you are looking for by referring to the attached PCB images.

I've not been able to find a suitable datasheet for the IC labaled U (charge controller)based on its markings. The PDF provided is for a pin-compatible part.

This info is only roughly verified. Please use it AT YOUR OWN RISK. Li-Ion batteries can ve very harmful if handled incorrectly. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO EVEN DISASSEMBLE THE DRILL UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

Feel free to open an issue/pull request if any mistake is found.
